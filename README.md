Angular IdentityServer WebAPI

This repo consist of 3 basic projects. Client, Authentication Service and a WebAPI. The reason I used 3 separate project is to simulate
a scenario where the client access an already existing api and an authentication service.

## Features

* Token based authentication
* Web API access
* Login, Register & Change password
* Form input validation
* Angular Material Design

## Steps to run the project
Note: First time you open the projet, it will install / download / restore all the dependencies (2 - 5mins) depending on your internet speed. <br />

After Visual Studio installed all the dependencies 
1. In Visual Studio run the project `IdentityServer`
2. In Visual Studio run the project `WebAPI`
3. Open cmd/powershell or any other command line interface and navigate to `Angular-IdentityServer-WebAPI/src/Angular/ClientApp` then type `npm install`.
